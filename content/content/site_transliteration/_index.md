title: Site transliteration
---

It is nice to have a website operator can drop into their website and allow users to choose their preferred script.

## Packages
- translipi ([installation instructions](https://github.com/srikanthsubra/translipi), [example](http://stotrasamhita.net/wiki/Aditya_Hrdayam)
- akSharamukhA demo [here]().
  - You need to add the following within the head section of your website: `<script src="http://www.virtualvinodh.com/aksharamkh/aksharamukha.js"></script>`.
  - Any block of text that must be converted must be assigned the class aksharamukha-text . The converter will pick up the input script automatically. If you need to specify an input script, add another class like inputscript-Telugu.

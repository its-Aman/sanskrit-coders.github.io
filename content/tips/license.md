Why open source?
----------------

For us to rapidly achieve our dreams, it is important that we are able to rapidly build on each otherâ€™ work, without unnecessary duplication of effort. For this reason open source software and freely available data are important.

Of course, non-community based, closed source software and restricted data are very valuable and useful to end users (eg spokensanskrit.de), but a previous attempt tells me that it can be difficult/ slow to elicit cooperation/ responsiveness when it comes to building on that work. Several websites may well be accessible to end users, but closed source and restricted data is just that (irrespective of whether that data is monetized).
